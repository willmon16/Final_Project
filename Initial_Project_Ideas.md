## What Computational Physics is Really About
There are many ways to model physics in real life ways for us to understand. These include: A chart showing the transfers of energy as a block slides along a table, an equation for the gravitational force between two objects, a differential equation describing the motion of a mass on a spring, and a computer program that calculates the motion of a baseball with air resistance. These are many models and not all models have to be mathematical models.

When talking about computational physics some key points are that computers are very important and code can be ran to analyze data. This bridges both theory and experiment. We can use physics for like projectiles and springs to be models computationally. These can be plotted to so we have a visualization of them. Computational is where we do theoretical physics where we build models. 

## 12 Steps Toward Rock-Solid Scientific Python Code
Following these 12 steps will allow you to have confidence in your computer skills, accelerate and better communicate on the computer, and finally work better with others.

The first step is to use verion control. This helps by keeping steps and work ordered. Then put the code in the cloud so it can be reviewed and edited by peers. Add a README and a License so we can describe  to our audience the purpose of the code and they can exicute it. Make sure there are docstrings so people reading your code can understand it better. Other smaller steps are to write tests, keep track of issues, automate tests and the build, use continuous integration, monitor test coverage. Finally it is important to write narrative documentation so the audience is able to better understand the reason for every part of your project and also so peers and help find issues in your project.


# Other
 As far as projects go I plan on doing another project out of Giordano. I like his book most and the problems in them. One neat project would be the billiards problem, or another oscillatory problem. I may even look into different projectile motions not in the book.

# Outline

# Intro to Physics of The Billiard Problem
The Billiard Problem relates to the concept of chaotic systems. This system is that of a ball that rolling on a frictionless table. The table can be of anyshape but for the sake of this project, two table shapes will be observed, stadium and elliptical. The balls on the table roll at a constant veloctiy in both the x and the y direction, the velocity being defined as the chagne in distance over a period time. The velocity is only changed when the ball collides with the walls of the table, this causes the ball to then reflect off the wall where the angle between the norm of the wall and the path of the ball both before and after collision is the smae. This collision in this problem is elastic, which means no energy is lost in the collision off the wall. Thus, the velocity parallel to the wall after the collision is same as the initial and the perpendicular velocity is the opposite a sthe initial perpendicular velocity. The purpose of this problem is to give a ball initial conditions and model the trajectory over time with respect to table shape.
