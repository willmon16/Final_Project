The Billiard Problem
========

The Billiard Problem will simulate the chaotic system where a billiard ball is rolling on a frictionless table of various shapes. This ball will interact with the walls elastically.The code will then model the trajectories of the billards ball on different size stadium tables along with different table shapes.

The code was written by William Willmon with assistance from Dr. Danielle McDermott.

Features
--------

- Allows user to change dimensions of tables
