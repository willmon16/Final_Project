# Final_Project
A Repository where my work and progress on my final project will be stored.

My code will simulate the chaotic system where a billiard ball is rolling on a frictionless table of various shapes. This ball will interact with the walls elastically.The code will then model the trajectories of the billards ball on different size stadium tables along with different table shapes.

Installing my code...When done installing, it is necessary to also install.

The code was written by William Willmon with assistance from Dr. Danielle McDermott.
