    "# Final Project: The Billiards Problem\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The physics Billiard Problem is the concept of chaotic systems. This system is that of a ball that rolling on a frictionless table. The table can be of anyshape but for the sake of this project, two table shapes will be observed, stadium and elliptical. The balls on the table roll at a constant veloctiy in both the x and the y direction, the velocity being defined as the chagne in distance over a period time. The velocity is only changed when the ball collides with the walls of the table, this causes the ball to then reflect off the wall where the angle between the norm of the wall and the path of the ball both before and after collision is the smae. This collision in this problem is elastic, which means no energy is lost in the collision off the wall. Thus, the velocity parallel to the wall after the collision is same as the initial and the perpendicular velocity is the opposite a sthe initial perpendicular velocity. The purpose of this problem is to give a ball initial conditions and model the trajectory over time with respect to table shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The necessary equations for the billiard problem are shown below. The first two equations are the velocity of the ball between the walls. These equations are stating that the velocity in the x direction is the change in the x position over a certain time interval and same for the y velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dx}{dt} = v_{x} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dy}{dt} = v_{y}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second set of equation is used to descrcribe the components of the velocity before it collides with the wall. The velocity is broken up into two vectors. The first being the vector perpendicular to the wall. This is measure by projection the velocity vector onto the vector normal to the wall. We can then use the second equation which states that the parallel velocity is the velocity vector minus the perpendicular component.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{v}_{i,\\perp} = (\\vec{v}_{i} \\bullet \\hat{n})\\hat{n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{v}_{i,\\parallel} = \\vec{v}_{i} - \\vec{v}_{i,\\perp}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The final set of equations gives us our velocity components after the collision. It shows that the final perpendicular component is the negative of the initial perpendicular component and the final parallel component is equal to the initial parallel component.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{v}_{f,\\perp} = -\\vec{v}_{i,\\perp}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{v}_{f,\\parallel} = \\vec{v}_{i,\\parallel}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the equations above we will be looking at a few different scenerios. The first being the trajectory of the ball in a stadium table. This is a table that is similar to a rectangle but with semi-circles on either end, and the length,$\\alpha$, of the rectangle can be changed. We will then test different shapes of tables such as and ellipse and a rectangle. For each table we will then test multiple initial conditions ie velocity and positions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The boundary conditions that must be considered are the size and shape of the table that the ball is on, the coefficient of friction between the ball and table is zero, the collisions between the ball and the wall is completely elastic, the initial velocity of the ball is greater than 0, and the $\\alpha $ of the stadium table is greater than or equal to zero."
